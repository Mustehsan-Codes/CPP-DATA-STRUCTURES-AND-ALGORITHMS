The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH[7] and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron,[8] the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016.[9][10] The car's design was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.[11]

The car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron.[12] The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.

Specifications and performance

Two-tone paint is a distinctive option

The quad-turbocharged W16 engine of the Chiron with attached dual-clutch transmission
The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103.25 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[14][15]

Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[16][17][18] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[19]

The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[20]

The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.[3][21] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.[22] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).[23]

Sales
The first 200 cars were sold before the first was delivered.[24] The base price is €2,400,000[25][24] and buyers were required to place a €200,000 deposit before their purchase.[24] The first three Chiron were delivered to their owners in Europe and the Middle East in March 2017.[26] In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold, although as of January 2022, not all have been manufactured.[1]

At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron, named the Chiron Sport. Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version, generating 1,500 PS (1,105 kW; 1,480 hp) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while maintaining its grand touring characteristics. The steering of the car has also received modifications and a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for improved handling in tight corners has been added. Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race track. The Chiron Sport became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron.[27][6]

In April 2022, Bugatti issued a factory recall for a 2018 Chiron, built 16 November 2017, due to a loose front frame support screw.[28][29]
